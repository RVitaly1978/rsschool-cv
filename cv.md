# Summary

1. Vitaly, Raicheu.
2. My contact info:
  - email: RVitaly1978@gmail.com
  - phone: +375292639055
  - viber: +375259121060.
3. I want to get some new knowledge, an interesting work in a friendly team. It is very important for me to do interesting things, improve my knowledge and be a part of a team.
4. My programming skills are quite modest. But to do my current job, I had to learn a lot of software stuff like *SCAD Office*, *Autocad*, *MS Office*, and many others, so my learning skills are on a good level i think.
5. My code example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ru">
  <head>
    <title>Пример</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <p class="page-title">Блог</p>
      <nav class="blog-navigation">
        <a href="index.html">На главную</a>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <article>
        <h1>Заголовок 1</h1>
        <p>Текст...</p>
      </article>
      <aside class="partnership">
        Тут могла быть ваша реклама
      </aside>
    </main>
    <footer>
      Подвал сайта
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

6. Unfortunately, I haven't had programming experience for the last 20 years. Recently, I walked a few steps in the interactive **HTML** and **CSS** courses of the [HTML academy](https://htmlacademy.ru/courses).
7. In 2000 I graduated with honors from the Belarusian National Technical University with a specialty in industrial and civil engineering.
8. I have a basic level of English. Unfortunately, I've hardly had some real practice in English so far. But I started to study on my own and plan to improve my English.
